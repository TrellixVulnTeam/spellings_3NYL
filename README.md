## Spelling worksheet

My Mum is a teacher and each week she has to prepare several worksheets to help children to spell. This is very time consuming 
and a large bulk of the work could be automated. This repository aims to do so. 

### Overview 

Each week a child is given a worksheet aimed at helping them to learn how to spell about 10 high frequency words. The work sheet consists of example sentences containing each word where the word is replaced by blanks and a section where each one of the words for a given week is repeated 6 times with varying numbers of letters replaced by blanks. 

### Blanks

Part of the worksheet involves children filling in letters on words with blanks in. A blank here is defined by " _ ". An example of this
would be for a child to fill in "c _ u _ d" with "o" and "l" in the respective blanks. On each worksheet there are roughly ten words 
and the child is required to fill in the blanks for each word about six times, where the number of blanks is varied. 

### Example sentences

The other part of the worksheet is to provide example sentences of the words for that week where these words are blanked out. For example, if one of the words for the week is "house" the sentence could be:
"The _ _ _ _ _ had a small garden."
