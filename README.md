## Spelling worksheet

My Mum is a teacher and each week she has to prepare several worksheets to help children to spell. This is very time consuming 
and a large bulk of the work could be automated. This repository aims to do so. 

### Blanks

Part of the worksheet involves children filling in letters on words with blanks in. A blank here is defined by " _ ". An example of this
would be for a child to fill in "c _ u _ d" with "o" and "l" in the respective blanks. On each worksheet there are roughly ten words 
and the child is required to fill in the blanks for each word about six times, where the number of blanks is varied.
